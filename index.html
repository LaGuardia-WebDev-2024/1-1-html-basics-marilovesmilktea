<h4>
  a small poem about flo ( for the purposes of this assignment ;3 )
  </h4>
 <p>
   three members,<br>
   three voices. <br>
   three distinct sounds, <br>
   but they make simlar choices. <br>
<br>
their music makes me smile, <br>
   from ear to ear, <br>
   and everytime their song "check" comes on, <br>
   i can't help but dance if there's no one near.
